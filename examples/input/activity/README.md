# Activity Diagrams

Activity diagrams show workflows and business processes with decision points, parallel processing, and control flow. They're perfect for modeling business processes, system workflows, and algorithmic procedures.

## Key Features

- Start and end nodes
- Decision points and branching
- Parallel processing (fork/join)
- Swimlanes for different actors
- Notes and annotations
- Conditional loops and iterations
- Color coding and styling

## Usage

Each example can be rendered using any PlantUML processor:

```bash
# Using PlantUML JAR
java -jar plantuml.jar filename.puml

# Using PlantUML online
# Copy the content to http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/

# Using VS Code with PlantUML extension
# Open the .puml file and use Alt+D to preview
```

## Learning Path

For beginners, we recommend starting with:

1. **Basic examples** (01-05): Learn fundamental syntax and basic elements
2. **Styling examples** (06-10): Understand customization and visual formatting  
3. **Advanced examples** (11+): Explore complex features and integration patterns
