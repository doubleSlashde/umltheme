# Class Diagrams

Class diagrams represent object-oriented design with classes, relationships, inheritance, and associations. They show the static structure of a system including classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.

## Key Features

- Class definitions with attributes and methods
- Inheritance and generalization
- Associations and aggregations
- Interfaces and abstract classes
- Package organization
- Visibility modifiers
- Stereotypes and constraints

## Usage

Each example can be rendered using any PlantUML processor:

```bash
# Using PlantUML JAR
java -jar plantuml.jar filename.puml

# Using PlantUML online
# Copy the content to http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/

# Using VS Code with PlantUML extension
# Open the .puml file and use Alt+D to preview
```

## Learning Path

For beginners, we recommend starting with:

1. **Basic examples** (01-05): Learn fundamental syntax and basic elements
2. **Styling examples** (06-10): Understand customization and visual formatting  
3. **Advanced examples** (11+): Explore complex features and integration patterns
